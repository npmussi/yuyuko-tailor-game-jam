From my understanding of the game skeleton:

1. Player
Yuyuko.
player.gd controls the movement, the "stamina" system that will be her invisibility, health, camera controls, and her own noise generation.

Exposed variables control her speed while walking/invisible, noise radius, etc. Can also expose her invisibility system parameters (upgrades?)
