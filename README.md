# MSX Stealth Game Skeleton

A complete stealth game prototype built in Godot 4.4+. Features player movement, enemy AI with patrol/alert/investigation states, vision cones, noise detection, traps, and win conditions. Perfect foundation for building stealth-based games.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Open the project** in Godot 4.4 or later
2. **Open the main scene**: `scenes/level_1.tscn` 
3. **Press F5** or click the Play button
4. **Move with WASD**, **sneak with C**
5. **Avoid guards** and reach the green **Win Area** to complete the level

## üéÆ Controls

- **WASD** - Move player
- **C** - Toggle sneak mode (uses stamina)

## üéØ Variables Map

### Player (`src/player/player.gd`)
- `player_speed` - Normal walking speed
- `sneak_speed` - Sneaking movement speed
- `MAX_STAMINA` - Maximum stamina capacity
- `STAMINA_DRAIN_RATE` - How fast stamina depletes while sneaking
- `STAMINA_REGEN_RATE` - Passive stamina recovery rate


### Guards (`src/enemy/guard.gd`)
- `enemy_speed` - Guard movement speed during alert/chase
- `view_angle` - Vision cone angle in degrees (90¬∞ default)
- `view_distance` - How far guards can see (75 units default)
- `alert_time` - Duration of alert state before aggressive behavior
- `min_patrol_speed` / `max_patrol_speed` - Patrol speed range
- `bullet_speed` - Speed of guard bullets
- `scan_rotation_speed` - How fast guards turn during scanning

### Win Condition (`src/props/WinArea.gd`)
- `win_message` - Text displayed on win screen
- `restart_delay` - Seconds to wait before restarting
- `next_level_scene` - Path to next level (for progression systems)

### Traps (`src/traps/SpikeTrap.gd`)
- `spike_frames` - Total animation frames for spike trap
- `activation_delay` - Time before spikes activate after triggering
- `retraction_delay` - Time spikes stay extended

### Trap Groups (`src/traps/TrapGroup.gd`)
- `trap_pattern` - Coordination pattern (Sequential, Alternating, Random, Synchronized)
- `pattern_delay` - Delay between trap activations in group
- `sync_offset` - Time offset for this group vs others

### Projectiles (`src/projectiles/SimpleBullet.gd`)
- `speed` - Bullet travel speed (225.0 - faster than guards to prevent collision issues)
- `lifetime` - Seconds before bullet auto-removes (3.0 default)

### Environmental Zones (`NoisyArea.gd`)
- `noise_multiplier` - How much louder footsteps are in this area (2.0 default)

## üé® How to Swap Art

### Player & Enemy Sprites
1. Replace `assets/sprites/player.png` with your player sprite
2. Replace `assets/sprites/enemy.png` with your guard sprite
3. Both sprites are scaled to 0.6 for consistency - adjust in scene files if needed

### Environment Assets
- **Tiles**: Replace files in `assets/tiles/` 
- **Props**: Snow crates in `assets/sprites/` can be replaced with your own props
- **UI Icons**: Guard state icons in `assets/sprites/icons/`

### Sprite Requirements
- **Static images only** - no animation sheets needed
- **PNG format** recommended
- **Power-of-2 sizes** work best (32x32, 64x64, etc.)
- Import settings will auto-generate on replacement

### Tilemap Setup
- Main tilemap uses `assets/tiles/tilesheet.png`
- Collision and navigation are set up automatically
- Modify TileMap node in `level_1.tscn` to adjust level layout

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Systems
- **Player Controller** - Movement, stamina, noise generation with terrain modifiers
- **Guard AI** - Patrol ‚Üí Alert ‚Üí Investigate ‚Üí Scanning state machine with shooting
- **Vision System** - Cone-based line-of-sight with raycasting and alert icons
- **Noise System** - Footstep detection with environmental sound zones
- **Trap System** - Animated spike traps with coordinated group patterns
- **Projectile System** - Guard bullets with physics simulation and auto-cleanup
- **Win Condition** - Area2D trigger with overlay UI and scene progression hooks

### Scene Structure
```
scenes/level_1.tscn          # Main game scene
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Player                   # Player character (src/player/player.tscn)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Guards                   # Enemy guards (src/enemy/guard.tscn)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PatrolPoints            # Guard waypoint nodes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Traps                   # Spike traps (src/traps/SpikeTrap.tscn)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TrapGroups          # Coordinated trap timing (src/traps/TrapGroup.gd)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Props                   # Environment objects and snow crates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NoisyAreas              # Environmental sound zones (NoisyArea.gd)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WinArea                 # Victory condition (src/props/WinArea.tscn)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ StaminaUI              # UI overlay (src/ui/StaminaUI.tscn)
```

### Extension Points
- **Next Level Progression** - Set `next_level_scene` in WinArea
- **Additional Guard Types** - Extend guard.gd base class
- **New Trap Types** - Follow SpikeTrap pattern or create TrapGroup coordination
- **Environmental Zones** - Use NoisyArea pattern for different surface effects
- **Projectile Weapons** - Extend SimpleBullet for different ammunition types
- **Custom Win Conditions** - Modify WinArea.gd trigger logic
- **Advanced AI** - All scripts include comprehensive headers for AI expansion context
